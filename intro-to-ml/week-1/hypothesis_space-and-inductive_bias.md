# Inductive Learning/Prediction   

Examples are given $\rightarrow$ $(\^{x},\space y)$ or $(\^{x},\space f(\^{x}))$. Where $\^{x}$ is the input and $y$ is the output parameter.  

Classification $\rightarrow$ $f(\^{x})$ is discrete.  
Regression $\rightarrow$ $f(\^{x})$ is continuous.
Probability estimation $\rightarrow$ $f(\^{x}) =$ Probability of $\^{x}$
